      <p>This is a prototype lens rental application. The backend is powered by
        Flask, PostgreSQL, Celery, and Redis, and the frontend is powered by
        Bootstrap 4, Typeahead/Bloodhound, and DataTables. Users can create,
        retrieve, edit, and delete, catalog of lenses and customers. Lenses and
        can rented out and returned. Newsletters can also be sent
        (asynchronously) to subscribed customers.

      <p>The name of this application is a reference to Leica, a German Company
        that manufactures optics and high-end cameras. Leica is one of my
        favorite lens makers for 35mm lenses. I've pre-populated the catalog with a few
        of their well-known LTM and M lenses. I've taken the banner image from their
        website (no copyright infringement intended). </p>
